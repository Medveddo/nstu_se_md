# Parallel data processing - Lab 2 - Benchmark

In this work you need to run some programming task that calculates somethig with mathematical operations (sin, cos, multiplication, ...). You need to run it multiple times to measure run time. Then you can calculate CPU perfomance and compare it with CPU frequency.

## How to run

```bash
make bench_float_o0
make bench_float_o3
make bench_double_o0
make bench_double_o3
```
